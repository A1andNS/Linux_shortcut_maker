# Linux_shortcut_maker
This is a script based on Python3 for Linux to create a shotcut in launcher
## Profile

I have writen a blog about how to create a shotcut in Deepin Linux. The way to creat a .desktop file was introduced by me in that blog article named "Desktop File Learning". Then I design a script that is based on Python3 to create the .desktop quickly and  conveniently, we can save the step to move the .desktop to the right directory.

I can use this script to create the shotcut in launcher more quickly.I test this in Ubuntu and Deepin Linux

## How to use it

Firstly, you need to configure a Python3 environment.

Then, run the script via root user.

For example: `python3 deepin-shotcut-maker.py`(root user) or  `sudo python3 deepin-shotcut-maker.py`
